# hello-world

Hi there, Esdras here
I'm starting my journey through this world of coding at github.
IÂ´m a student of eletrical engineer at Brazil, here I learn how to code at C and python and it was a good experience.
Since then, I'm interested in programming and I want to count with your help to guide me.
